    "Here we are trying to predict via personal info whether or not one could be approved for credit card.\n",

    "Problem statement: According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, approximately 45 million Americans do not have a credit score, preventing most from obtaining mortgages, car loans, and even personal loans. This problem stems from a lack of financial literacy among Americans and itâ€™s costing millions of households thousands of dollars every year. The easiest way to build credit is through credit cards, where people can develop a credit history and improve their credit over time. Before applying for credit, people must meet a certain set of criteria like age of credit, income, cost of housing, etc. This data is then used by banks to determine credit worthiness and applicants are either approved or denied, with very little feedback given to applicants who were denied. We propose an ML model to help applicants gauge their creditworthiness before applying, helping them avoid an unnecessary credit score drop from a hard pull on their credit report.\n"

    "After that there are 2 more preprocessing steps I have identified so far, there could be more. However, we need to preform a vintage anyalysis on the Credit_record.csv to create the label in which we will be predicting and then we have to remove some Null values.\n",

We could have choosen a differnet data set with the label that tells if someone has been approved, but like in real scenarios the data being used might not always be complete. So instead we are using Vintage Analysis to preform some data processing on the credit record to create a label that would mimic a credit card approved label. Vintage Analysis is one of many popular methods for accessing credit risk. It is used to determine the number of months' data you should consider for performance window. If customer defaults (90 days or more past due) during the performance window, borrower would be considered as a risk and would more likely be declined for credit card approval. We will use this combinedd with a proportion of the customers past due to determine their likelyhood of being approved for credit or not. 1 being that they meet all criteria to being approved and 0 being that they are not apporved."
